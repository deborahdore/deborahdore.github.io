My background is rooted in Artificial Intelligence. During my Bachelor's, I studied core topics in Computer Science such
as Databases, Algorithms, and Programming. In my Master's, I specialized in AI through courses in Machine Learning, Deep
Learning, and Natural Language Processing, which naturally led me to pursue a Ph.D.

Currently, I focus on Argument Mining, a subfield of NLP concerned with automatically identifying arguments in text and
classifying their structure—claims, premises, and their supporting or attacking relationships. This technology can help
expose logical fallacies and propaganda, fostering more informed public discourse.

My research applies Argument Mining to political debates, where speakers build complex argumentative structures. Mapping
these interactions can support voters in making better-informed decisions.
