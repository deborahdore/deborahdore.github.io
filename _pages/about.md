My background has always revolved around Artificial Intelligence. During my bachelor, I began studying Computer Science;
basic subjects included Databases, Algorithms, Mathematical Analysis and Coding. Later, during my Master, I specialized
in Artificial Intelligence through the study of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing. The
choice to do a Ph.D. was a natural consequence of my studies.

Nowadays, my work focuses on Argument Mining, a recent sub-field of Natural Language Processing. Argument Mining deals
with the automatic extraction of arguments, and their boundaries, from natural language text. Arguments can be connected
with other arguments through supporting or attacking relations. An argument can be classified into “a claim” or “a
premise”. A claim is a statement while a premise is another statement done to support or attack the claim. Argument
identification and relation classification are the basic principal tasks of Argument Mining. Understanding arguments and
their relations can help the general public detect logical fallacies and propaganda in someone’s speech and therefore
help the public to be prevented from manipulation.

My work primarily focuses on the application of Argument Mining in political debates. During the debates, a candidate
can make a claim and a premise to support that claim; its opponent can make another claim attacking the debaters’ claim
and so on. This creates an intricate argumentation graph that forms a natural application for argument mining
techniques. In this domain, Argument Mining can ultimately help the voters make a more accurate and thoughtful decision.
